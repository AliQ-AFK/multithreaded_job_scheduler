## 📺 Demo

![Job Processing Demo](https://github.com/AliQ-AFK/multithreaded_job_scheduler/issues/1#issue-2705805302)

### Steps Shown in the Demo:
1. Dynamic job generation and arrival.
2. Concurrent execution using mutex and semaphore synchronization.
3. Color-coded log output for easy monitoring.
4. Performance statistics displayed after execution.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multiple Synchronization Methods**:
  - Mutex-based execution for strict mutual exclusion.
  - Semaphore-based execution for resource counting.
  - Unsynchronized execution for performance comparison.
- **Job Processing**:
  - Print and scan job simulation.
  - Dynamic job generation and arrival time-based scheduling.
  - Page-based job execution.

### Development Features
- **Comprehensive Sanitizer Integration**:
  - Address Sanitizer for memory errors.
  - Undefined Behavior and Leak Sanitizers.
- **Robust Warning Flags**:
  - Includes `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Werror`, and `-Wformat-security`.
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Unit tests for all components.
  - Memory leak detection.
  - Thread safety validation and stress testing.
  - Performance benchmarking.

## 🧹 Cleanup
```bash
# Clean build files
make clean

# Clean log files
make clean-logs

# Clean everything
make clean-all
```

---

## 🔍 Logging System

The project includes a comprehensive logging system with:
- Dedicated log directory for all execution types.
- Color-coded log levels for better readability.
- Thread-specific logging for debugging.
- Automatic cleanup functionality.
- Detailed execution tracking and timing.

---

## 🔒 Thread Safety

Three synchronization mechanisms are implemented:
1. **Mutex-based Execution**:
   - Traditional mutual exclusion.
   - Strict resource access control.
   - Deadlock prevention.

2. **Semaphore-based Execution**:
   - Resource counting mechanism.
   - Multiple access control.
   - Fair scheduling.

3. **Unsynchronized Execution**:
   - No synchronization mechanisms.
   - Used for performance comparison.
   - Demonstrates race conditions.

---

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

Each execution method provides:
- Total jobs processed.
- Print/scan job completion rates.
- Execution time statistics.
- Thread-specific performance data.
- Resource utilization metrics.
